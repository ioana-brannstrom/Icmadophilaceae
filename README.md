# Icmadophilaceae
Scripts and pipelines used in the Icmadophilaceae study 


Here you'll find the scripts and pipelines associated to the study Onut-Brännström, Ament-Velásquez, Tuovinen, et al. (work in progress). From Sex to Sterility: Evolution of Mating Systems in the Lichen-Forming Fungal Family Icmadophilaceae


There are four main folders:

Phylogenies: Phylogenies of the MAT locus of the Icmadophilaceae family, designed to run in UPPMAX (Uppsala Multidisciplinary Center for Advanced Computational Science).

Lichen Ploidy: a Snakemake pipeline to infer the ploidy (sensu lato, since it would include heterokaryosis) from a (meta)genome, as well as additional analysis to show that the triploid-like samples look like hybrids.
