# Icmadophilaceae
Scripts and pipelines used in the Icmadophilaceae study 


Here you'll find the scripts and pipelines associated to the study Onut-Brännström, Ament-Velásquez, Tuovinen, et al. (work in progress). From Sex to Sterility: Evolution of Mating Systems in the Lichen-Forming Fungal Family Icmadophilaceae


These are the following folders connected with the **Material & Methods** section:

**Phylogenies** 
1) Phylogenies of the MAT (mating) genes, designed to run in UPPMAX (Uppsala Multidisciplinary Center for Advanced Computational Science).
2) Phylogeny inferred from 1,682 BUSCO genes used to investigate the evolutionary relationships within the Icmadophilaceae family

**Lichen Ploidy**
This analysis builds on scripts from the:  https://github.com/johannessonlab/Letharia/tree/master/LichenPloidy
